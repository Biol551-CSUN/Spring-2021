# Outline of class

1. Create a data sheet for the field/lab

1. Create a data sheet for data analysis

These are two different, but equally important tools for transparent data.

---

# What are the dimensions of your data?

--
 
 ### - Number of complete observations
-  A water sample

-  A mouse is a trial

--

### - Number of things measured per observation
- In the water I measured pH, nitrate, and salinity

- I measured the height and weight of the mouse

---
# Wide data

 ### One observation per row and all the different variables are columns


| Sample ID| Treatment   |      Nitrate      | Temp | Salinity | 
|----------|:-------------:|------:|----:|-----:|
| 1 | High|  1.2 | 7.2| 34.1|
| 2 | High|    3.0   | 7.8| 34.0|
| 3 | Low |2.4 | 8.0|34.2|
| 4 | Low |5.1| 8.0| 33.0|
| 5 | Low| 1.1| 7.9| 34.5|


---

# Long  data

 ### One unique measurement per row and all the info about that measurement in the same row


| Sample ID| Treatment   |      Measurement_Type      | Value | Units | 
|----------|:-------------:|------:|----:|
| 1 | High|  Nitrate | 1.2| uM_L|
| 1 | High|    Temp   | 7.2| deg_C |
| 1 | High |Salinity | 34.1|psu|
| 2 | High |Nitrate| 3.0| uM_L|
| 2 | High| Temp| 7.9| deg_C|
| 2 | High| Salinity| 34.0| psu|


--

There are pros and cons to both depending on the type of data you collect. These will become more evident as you code throughout the semester.

---

# Creating a good data collecting sheet

1. How easy is it to read?

1. Are column and row definitions clear?

1. Is there metadata?

1. How similar is it to your data entry sheet?

1. Can you use it at 4am?

# We live in a data filled world


## Data can take make forms
<img src="https://businessoverbroadway.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/big-data.jpg" width=50%, align="right" />
- Althetic performance
- Timeseries of polls
- Sequence Data
- Measurements of physical properties
- Spatial data (e.g., Maps)
- Timing of events
- Images
- Networks
- Plain Text 
- So much more....

# But, first, tell me about you...
Ice Breaker: 
1. tell us your name 
1. why you wanted to take this class 
1. if you could create any function in the world what would it be?

# Our semester: venturing into the wonderful world of reproducible and transparent data

--

This class is **NOT**:
- A statistics course (check out Biometry)
- A bioinformtics course (check out bioinformatics)

--

We **will**:

- Learn best practices for data entry
- Learn how to create clean and reproducible scripts in the program *R*
- Learn to share code and data on a public version-controlled repository
- Work collaboratively on a project
- Create high quality visuals using *R*
- Learn to love working with Data!

# Our semester: venturing into the wonderful world of reproducible and transparent data

### We will create beautiful graphics that enable us to better understand our data using #TidyTuesday (details to follow)

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.width = 1}
library(tweetrmd)
tweet_screenshot(tweet_url("nsilbiger", "1219857312807940096"),
  #maxwidth = 100,
  theme = "dark",
  scale = 0.5
)


tweet_screenshot(tweet_url("dbarnas", "1260379224608669696"),
  #maxwidth = 100,
  theme = "dark",
  scale = 0.5
)


```

# Grading


| Component   |      Percent      |

I will go over each of these components in future lectures.   


All rubrics are on Canvas and details on syllabus.

# Communication
<img src = "https://seekvectorlogo.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/slack-technologies-vector-logo.png", width=50%, align="center" />

I created a class slack channel that you all can use to easily ask your classmates for help, give advice, and share resources.

[Click Here to Join](https://join.slack.com/t/biol551csun/shared_invite/zt-kgyyp4k3-lvbGUeyNnvqC1YFgb5h1FA) or see in the syllabus.

What is slack? [See here](https://slack.com/intl/en-pf/)

Is it free? **YES**

# How to get class assignments and lectures?

This week, everything will be on Canvas.
Starting next week all assignments and lecture slides will be on Github (a free online repository).  

- We will have weekly lab assignments that can be started (even completed!) during lab time.

--



What is Github?

Stay tuned....

# Readings

All textbooks are free and online for this class.

- Links for the books are in the syllabus.  

--

- All required reading (listed each week) should be completed **before** class.  

--

- Use active reading. Most readings come with code. If you do it before class then it will be much easier to work through and understand the content in class

# Projects

### Group Project
- Present an R package that we did not discuss in class and present it to your peers

--

### Independent Final Project
- Visualization and explanation of a data set of your choosing (from your own work or found data)
- Bringing together multiple data sets are encouraged!
- In the coming weeks start thinking about what data you would like to use and what questions you would like to answer. You will propose your ideas with me for approval.

# What is data?

---

# Data comes in lots of forms

### There are several **Data Types** in R that you will need to know

--
character : Can be a letter or a combination of letters enclosed by quotes is considered as a character data type by R. It can be alphabets or numbers  
- ex: "a", "my name is Dr. Silbiger"

--

 numeric: Numbers that have a decimal value or are a fraction in nature have a data type as numeric.(also called "double")  
- ex: 2.0, 14.573849 

--

 integer: Numbers that do not contain decimal values have a data type as an integer  
- ex: 1, 2, 3, 4

--

 logical: A variable that can have a value of True and False  
- ex: TRUE, FALSE

---

# Data types con't

complex: An imaginary number.
- ex: 1+4i

--

 factor: They are a data type that is used to refer to a qualitative relationship like colors, good & bad, course or movie ratings, etc. They are useful in statistical modeling.
- ex: "Good", "Better", "Best"

--

### Knowing the names of all these data types and what they mean is important

---
# Data can also come in many *structures*

# Data can also come in many *structures*

| Dims   |      Homogeneous (same data type)     |   Heterogeneous (diff data type) |  
|----------|:-------------:|:------:|
|1D |  Atomic vector |    List     |
|2D |    Matrix   | DataFrame |
| ND | Array |    |

 ```{r, echo=FALSE}

### Our first lab is an intro to R/R refresher. 

### But, first, a 10 minute break!

### Next class is all about making data sheets. Don't forget to read the assignment before class.
