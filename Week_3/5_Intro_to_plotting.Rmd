What are the 5 sections you should always have in your scripts?

# Why you should always look at your data

We have to really understand our data to be able to decide on the appropriate analyses to answer our research questions. It can also lead to unexpected & interesting research questions. That requires first **looking** at your data, usually in a number of ways, to ask questions like: 

--

- Are there interesting patterns, groups, trends or relationships?  
- How are observations distributed?  
- Are there outliers?  
- Is there notable bias in observations or missing observations?  

--

**When do I need to look at my data and think about it really hard before analyzing it?**  

--

***EVERY TIME***

--

**When can I just make assumptions about the data and some some regression or hypothesis testing or anything else without exploring it?**

--

***NEVER***

---
# Start exploring with visualizations that don't hide or assume anything about the data

# For continuous (measured) observations you might start with:

- Jitter plots (if logical groups exist)  
- Beeswarm plots (ggbeeswarm)  
- Scatterplots (2 variables, or map additional)  
- More variables: map w/ colors, size?


---
# Jitter plots:   
Show values of observations within a group, adding some amount of “jitter” so that they don’t all overlap 

.pull-left[
```{r, plot-label, eval=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
ggplot(chickwts, aes(x = feed, y = weight))+
  geom_jitter(aes(color = feed),
              alpha = 0.4,
              width = 0.1,
              height = 0,
              size = 3,
              show.legend = FALSE)+
  scale_color_brewer(palette = "Dark2")+
  theme_light()
```
]

.pull-right[
```{r plot-label-out, ref.label="plot-label", echo=FALSE}
