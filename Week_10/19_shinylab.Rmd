# Shiny lab assignment

Make a simple shiny app! 
Because this is a more difficult task, you have a full week to turn it in (due next **Wednesday morning at 9am**).

Advice: Start with your basic r code. Do you want to make a plot? A table? Ignore the app at first and just code up your general output.  

Next, decide what you want to be *reactive*. What do you want the user to be able to manipulate.  

Next, take a piece of paper and draw out what you want your app to look like.  This will help you format your ui and look up terms for what goes inside. For example, do you want radio buttons? A drop down? Fill in the blank? 

Start with your UI and then copy and past your code into the server and manipulate it as needed to fit your app.  I never code from scratch inside my server.

Have the cheatsheet and resources open and ready to go.

Change only one thing at a time and then look at it. Or else you will be in debugging hell....

# The data


.center[
<img src="libs/images/IMG_0230.JPG", width=40%>  
### Blakely and Micah
]

HatchBabyExport.csv has data of every dirty diaper (whether it was "wet", "dirty", or "both"), every time they fed/how many oz, some info on weight (lbs) and length (in), and helpful notes (i.e. was it a diaper explosion??) since they were born ~ 5 weeks ago.  

Your goal is to visualize these data using a shiny app. I **will** be sharing your apps with my brother and sister-in-law so make me proud!
